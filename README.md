# Master-Thesis
my master thesis project which is a multi agent system for stock price prediction using behavioral reasoning of traders and crisis prevention. 
Please read the report and watch the presentation attatched to better understand the code. 
The code can be integrated in google colab notebook. 
To get the code working you need to train the models and give permission to google drive fro storing the weights of the neural network. 
after getting the files from training, paste them in the root of your drive.
Enjoy the simulation :)
